			<h1 class="lead">My name is Dennis Kramer, and I'm a skier, climber, cyclist, and mountaineer. I currently work for <a href="http://www.etsy.com" target="_blank">Etsy</a> as a Product Designer, and live in Brooklyn Heights with my girlfriend, Lily.</h1>
			<p class="description">I grew up in New York City, and am still happy to call it my home. Though I mostly spent my youth in Manhattan, I now reside on the other side of the east river, in Brooklyn. I also enjoy illustration, brand development, and custom typography; I incorporate these in my work whenever I can.</p>
