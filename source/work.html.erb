			<p>While working at <a href="http://www.urbancompass.com" target="_blank">Urban Compass</a>, I participated in a Hackathon to come up with new products or features that could help improve the apartment rental/buying experience. I worked on a team of two to come up with Swift, an iPhone app that minimizes the work and stress of apartment hunting by pairing customers up with an agent and giving them a personal chat experience to let their agent know exactly what they like and don't like. Swift fully leverages the value of working with an agent within a trustworthy and transparent system, and provides agents with genuine leads that are more likely to stick with them.</p>
